Trivia and quiz games are popular for testing knowledge and engaging users in an interactive way. Our team has decided to develop a "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"-style quiz game where players answer a series of multiple-choice questions to win virtual prizes. The game will include features such as lifelines, a scoring system, and a time limit for each question.
